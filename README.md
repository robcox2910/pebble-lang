# Pebble

An educational compiler and bytecode VM for the **Pebble** programming language.

Pebble is a small imperative language that compiles to bytecode and runs on a
custom stack-based virtual machine. The project is designed for learning how
compilers work, built incrementally using TDD.

## Language Features

- Integers, floats, strings, booleans
- Variables (`let` declarations, `const`, reassignment)
- Arithmetic, comparison, bitwise, and logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Short-circuiting `and` / `or` and chained comparisons (`1 < x < 10`)
- Control flow: `if/else`, `while`, `for` loops, `match`
- Collections: lists, dicts, list comprehensions, slicing, tuple unpacking
- Functions (`fn`, `return`), default arguments, closures, and generators (`yield`)
- Async / await (`async fn`, `await`)
- Structs, classes with inheritance, and enums
- Error handling: `try` / `catch` / `finally` and `throw`
- Modules and imports (`import`, `from ... import`)
- String interpolation (`"hello {name}"`)
- `print()` built-in
- Comments (`#`)
- Curly-brace blocks, newline-delimited statements (no semicolons)

## Example

```
let count = 0
while count < 5 {
    if count > 0 {
        print(count)
    }
    count = count + 1
}
```

## Pipeline

```
Source -> Lexer -> Parser -> Analyzer -> Module Resolver -> Type Checker -> Compiler -> Optimizer -> VM
```

See the [documentation](https://robcox2910.github.io/pebble-lang/) for a
kid-friendly walk-through of each stage.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint and type check
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright src tests
```

## Using Pebble from Python

```python
from pebble import run_source

print(run_source('print("Hello from Pebble!")'), end="")
```

`run_source`, `compile_source`, `check` and `format_source` are Pebble's public
API; see [Using Pebble from Python](docs/concepts/using-pebble-from-python.md).

## Releasing

Other projects in the series ([PyStack](https://github.com/robcox2910/pystack) and [PyLLM](https://github.com/robcox2910/pyllm)) use a pinned release of this one,
not whatever is on `main`. To publish a change for them:

1. Merge the change to `main`.
2. Tag it: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   A change to the public API bumps the minor version (`v0.1.0` → `v0.2.0`);
   anything else bumps the patch (`v0.1.0` → `v0.1.1`).
3. In each project that uses it, edit the tag in `[tool.uv.sources]`, run
   `uv lock --upgrade-package <name>`, and open a pull request so CI checks
   the pair together.
